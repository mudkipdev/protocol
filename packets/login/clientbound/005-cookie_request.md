| Direction   | State | ID     | Identifier                   |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Clientbound | Login | `0x05` | `minecraft:cookie_request`   |

## Description
The Cookie Request packet is part of Minecraft's state management system, allowing servers to request previously stored cookie data from clients. This mechanism enables persistent data storage across sessions and can be used for various authentication and session management purposes.

## Fields
| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| Key | Identifier | The identifier of the cookie |

## Usage
When a server sends this packet, it expects the client to respond with any stored data associated with the specified key. This system is particularly useful for maintaining session state, storing user preferences, or implementing custom authentication mechanisms. The client is expected to respond with a Cookie Response packet, even if it has no data for the requested key.

## Security Considerations
While cookies provide a convenient way to store session data, servers should not rely on them for critical security purposes as they can be modified or deleted by clients. They are best used for quality-of-life features or as part of a broader authentication system rather than as the sole source of security validation.
